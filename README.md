## Description

My Portfolio Page is here for you!
<br>
I wanted to make something easy for the user to navigate where they can get to know me a little better. 
<br>
You can read a bit more about me, navigate through my recent project links, visit my professional LinkedIn, read my resume, or contact me directly.
